{"Review_Date":"21 July 2023","Author":"LoveofLegacy","Rating":"6","Review_Title":" Beautiful film, but so preachy\n","Review":"Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie. Overall, the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at, but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the \"strong\" woman.","Review_Url":"\/review\/rw9239935\/?ref_=tt_urv"}

I was curious to see how they would evolve the \"stereotypical Barbie\" into something more. But the messaging in this movie was so heavy handed that it completely lost the plot.

It is so brilliantly handled and finely crafted, I have to give the filmakers credit. Yes, I am somewhat conservative person and former law enforcement officer. I'm a guy. I like guy things. Hell I even enjoyed the Battleship movie a few years ago (an absolutely ridiculous but fun romp of an action film). But I also like to experience other perspectives. And man oh man does this movie deliver that in spades - pretty much encapsulated everything my wife has tried to convey about her entire career and life experience wrapped up into two hours! The humor, the sets, the acting, and the ability to weave the current narrative into the story was just perfect. I don't agree with some of the points of the movie, but again, that's ok. This movie wasn't designed to give a balanced perspective of men versus women; it is a no-holds-barred unapologetic crazy ride of a rant about the real issues that women have faced since they were \"allowed\" to have \"real jobs\" and do the same things as men. Give me a well done film that is a blast to watch, that makes you think, and that was done from a place of creativity, passion, and attention to detail, and I'll call it what it is: a 10 out of 10 masterpiece.","Review_Url":"\/review\/rw9239935\/?ref_=tt_urv"}

Somehow, Greta Gerwig took Barbie, and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issues....well? It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect. Overall, Barbie is probably the best movie based off a toy (sorry LEGO Movies) and an overall fantastic time at the movies.","Review_Url":"\/review\/rw9239935\/?ref_=tt_urv"}

{"Review_Date":"21 July 2023","Author":"andermic18","Rating":"6","Review_Title":" No Direction\n","Review":"The movie was very funny and really enjoyable to laugh at with the full theatre. However, the messages of the movie were the problem. I was never really sure what I was supposed to take away, there was nothing about finding equality or love it was all about how every man cat falls every woman or women can't be anything. It was really silly because there was no accurate reflection of America at any single point except for Barbie getting called a Fascist for no reason by a 14 year old. I enjoyed how they called out women for hating women and how they really tried to preach empowerment and the ability to be anything, but at the same time there was so much resentment and they ended the movie by reinstating hate. The majority of the movie was hating men as much as possible. That's just whatever because what really matters is the story. Well it fell short on that mark and it was really disappointing. The pacing was horrible, the villain won and was pretty irrelevant in the long run, the story was all over the place, and it is totally not for kids. I think the worst part is how disappointed I was at the opportunity to really make something special and it just wasn't. 6 points for all the laughs and fun I had and I would expect 6-7 to be an appropriate rating.","Review_Url":"\/review\/rw9239935\/?ref_=tt_urv"}

{"Review_Date":"19 July 2023","Author":"AvionPrince16","Rating":"6","Review_Title":" Barbie land and reality\n","Review":"Im not really disappointed or love the movie to be honest. It was kind of weird and strange at the beginning: we understand it later because we are in the Barbie world. So they played with the culture reference of the barbie, the dolls and what they represent: an ideal world with where the womans are in power. Things will get pretty normal after they enter the real world and all the problems: sexual remark, womens and their place in society (the inequality with mens.) I was pretty sure they will talk about the problems with womans and their complex because of Barbie and the perfect women she is and how this is contrasted with the real world. Its pretty obvious that they will talk about it. I love also how Ken will also notice how mens are more powerful in the real world: its like everyone see that reality is not really what they perceived themselves in their own reality and power will shift also later in Barbie Land. I understand why they act like this and stuff but i didnt really get into the movie to be honest: i only identify myself when they talked about society and business but all the musical things, the choregraphy and even the morality was kind of superficial. But i enjoyed that Barbie realised the problems of our world and compare to her own. Some moments was funny and some more serious or drama sometimes even if its pretty soft because we are in Barbie Land. I mean i spend a great time but it was kind of ok. And i still think its a great Barbie movie: the task was not easy to represent that world but i enjoyed the set design, the colors, the camera movements. I think people who played with Barbie dolls or just know the universe will be happy; they have a lot of references to the world and a lot of Barbie references to the dolls and the differents clothes and the impact of her in society. Some moments were also absurd ( the fight with all the Kens). Its good anyway.","Review_Url":"\/review\/rw9239935\/?ref_=tt_urv"}
{"Review_Date":"21 July 2023","Author":"MaskedMinty","Rating":"5","Review_Title":" Preach Preach Preach\n","Review":"Let me start by saying that I'm by no means a conservative or traditional woman. I believe that inequality for women still is rampant even in first world countries and that we go through many problems. But damn...this movie is so corporate and shallow. It's clearly ordered and tailored by executives at Mattel to rebrand and sell more dolls. The movie starts well and has the potential of becoming something very good, but then it just goes downhill: the premise of the owner's feeling being projected onto the doll was going to lead to a very nice build up about a person's life journey and then Barbie and Ken go to the human world and cue in the speeches and preaching. This movie suffers from a bad case of showing and not telling, they keep repeating the same dialogues: patriarchy bad patriarchy bad patriarchy bad sexism sexism sexism, not even one time but MULTIPLE TIMES. These characters go into random rants like its a ted talk! The chemistry between the mother and daughter is absolutely nonexistent and their relationship is so cringe, You cant root for them or feel their feelings at all. Barbie should have understood how Kens had been feeling in the Barbieland the whole time which is a mimic of how many women are still treated in the society: just existing for the gaze of a woman (man). Yet what do they do? They manipulate them (with a super nonsense plan) and force them back to their original position while she gives him a half assed apology that could have been done better and end up to a more accurate point about equality. (I guess this is again meta and a reflection of how women are pitted against each other while people in charge benefit from that but its so badly done that it feels meh.)\nI can imagine that in the boardroom they went through a discussion like this: People are going to think this is a feel good movie so we need to give them something deeper but also lets make it absurd and fast paced so that we can finish the plot quickly and also jump on the \"not taking itself serious\" bandwagon and also market these dolls again in the age of smartphone kids. The only reason this movie gets at 5 from me is the humor, which sometimes becomes very meta and creative and Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling have acted very well. Besides this, they could have just given us a simple feel good movie and I would have respected the creators more. Pass.","Review_Url":"\/review\/rw9239935\/?ref_=tt_urv"}

Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't that what it is supposed to be? It's literally a movie about Barbie. Instead, it felt more like an agent of woke culture, and basically Mattel's (the company that produces Barbie dolls) way of capitalizing the emotional aspect of the cinephiles to make their business more popular and trendier. It continuously tried to portray the fact that Mattel is no more producing white barbie dolls, it is now producing dolls of all colors and races. Well, that is definitely a good thing, but making most of the movie focus on that aspect felt very boring and wrong. If they didn't quite make a movie that is fun and adventurous, why make the marketing events misleading? They could've just focused on the audience for whom it was made, rather than on the entire world through their absurdly irrelevant marketing events that made the world think that this movie is going to be all about fun and adventure. Sadly, it was not nearly as enjoyable as the misleading marketing made it seem.","Review_Url":"\/review\/rw9239935\/?ref_=tt_urv"}

The political message gives Barbie a new dimension I never thought would go to. I felt a hidden anti-war message in it actually which is deep for a toy I never thought would be taken that serious. Makes sense in order to explain the historical connotations about the franchise's history,but on rewatch I'll fast forward to the cheesy funny parts. Would I watch it again? Probably!!!!!!!!

It was kind of weird and strange at the beginning: we understand it later because we are in the Barbie world. So they played with the culture reference of the barbie, the dolls and what they represent: an ideal world with where the womans are in power. Things will get pretty normal after they enter the real world and all the problems: sexual remark, womens and their place in society (the inequality with mens.) I was pretty sure they will talk about the problems with womans and their complex because of Barbie and the perfect women she is and how this is contrasted with the real world. Its pretty obvious that they will talk about it. I love also how Ken will also notice how mens are more powerful in the real world: its like everyone see that reality is not really what they perceived themselves in their own reality and power will shift also later in Barbie Land. I understand why they act like this and stuff but i didnt really get into the movie to be honest: i only identify myself when they talked about society and business but all the musical things, the choregraphy and even the morality was kind of superficial. But i enjoyed that Barbie realised the problems of our world and compare to her own. Some moments was funny and some more serious or drama sometimes even if its pretty soft because we are in Barbie Land. I mean i spend a great time but it was kind of ok. And i still think its a great Barbie movie: the task was not easy to represent that world but i enjoyed the set design, the colors, the camera movements. Its good anyway.","Review_Url":"\/review\/rw9239935\/?ref_=tt_urv"}

The undeniable feminist tone exists through the presence of this female director - in addition to Margot Robbie herself as a producer. \"Barbie\" has sharp and intelligent comments on the dynamics between men and women over time and also on how these social roles are seen and problematized today. And the film does it with a big heart: the story is genuinely fun, with a humor that walks between acidity and innocence, but also moves with the existential journey of its protagonists, reserving touching moments and provoking reflections, especially in its final stretch. Debauchery is the great ally of Gerwig and Baumbach to deal not only with sexism, but also with the \"corporate\" issue. It won't be strange if you catch yourself thinking \"how did Mattel let this film see the light of day?\" Laughing at yourself, after all, seems to be a prerequisite for establishing communication with a young generation of consumers who associate their consumption habits with a critical eye on consumerism itself.","Review_Url":"\/review\/rw9239935\/?ref_=tt_urv"}

A reasonable assumption could be made that a movie based on a doll so popular with pre-adolescent girls would be geared towards that audience. However, this is the era of comic book movies targeting \"grown-ups\", and since we know, based on her previous work (the exceptional LADY BIRD, 2017), Greta Gerwig is an intelligent filmmaker, a more reasonable assumption is that she purposefully aimed the movie at women who once played with Barbie dolls and now fill their days with work, family, and adulting. This strategy has proven to be box office gold, and the heavy dose of cosplay at screenings proves the lasting impact this plastic doll has had on many women who lined up for tickets.","Review_Url":"\/review\/rw9239935\/?ref_=tt_urv"}

The way it handles its feminist message is not the best, because while it tries to give a meaningful speach, it almost boarders with hate speach and ridiculization, I say almost, because a lot of this situations are just played by the laughs and when theyre not, while being bad, theyre not terrible. But this makes it sound like a bad movie, which barbie is not, at the end it manages to actually give a meaningfull speech about the wrong in the real world and takes some minutes to understand both sides. It is still not the best ending possible because it can be a little too ridiculous, when you have a movie thats like that all the time I dont think it matters all that much.

The message of female empowerment was fine, but didn't really speak to gender equality. Barbieland is the opposite of real world where Barbies are in control and kens are perceived as the mindless accessories. However, the ending just puts Barbies back on top and doesn't do much to equality which I hope is our goal. The movie itself was very sloppy and all finish with no build up. You could tell the writers had ideas of what they wanted to have happen but had zero clue how to get there. They wanted Ken to take the patriarchy back to Barbieland but this happens immediately and off screen despite the Kens being bumbling morons the entire movie. It's all payoff and no buildup. Good acting from a strong cast made this more fun to watch but when you start thinking a little deeper it didn't make much sense.

The film starts strong with an impeccable introduction referencing \"2001: A Space Odyssey,\" and then transitions to the gigantic dollhouse that is Barbieland. The production design is simply incredible, the use of CGI is imperceptible, the practical effects are great, the costumes are unique, and the makeup and hair contribute to the excellent art direction. The performances are all good, especially those of Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, who as Ken manage to steal the scenes several times. The weakest point lies in the script, which hits and misses at every moment. Its execution is good, the story itself works well, even without explaining some details. Nothing comes close to hindering the experience. Greta aims to deliver strong critiques and attempts to remain neutral, but at a specific moment, she forces it too much, causing a disconnection with the viewer. In the following scene, there's a spectacular sequence involving Ken, creating a sensation that his storyline is better. It's not; it's just more entertaining. The only \"weak\" storyline is that of the human mother-daughter duo and the executives. It's one of the weaker aspects of a good, fun, exciting, and creative film, which falls short of being even better due to stumbling over its details.","Review_Url":"\/review\/rw9239935\/?ref_=tt_urv"}

{"Review_Date":"20 July 2023","Author":"threenails10","Rating":"9","Review_Title":" It's really something different and that's a good thing\n","Review":"It's really something different but some of it feels inspired by other films, I caught references to Fight Club, 2001 Space Odyssey, Lego Movie, and others I can't think of at the moment. But yeah, this was a special film. I don't think as many people will like it as it probably deserves. But I did love most of it. Sometimes the tones felt off at times but it's definitely recommended to see. The satire works great here and the production design, cinematography and acting (intentionally bad in a way on purpose in some spots to deliver the satire aspects) are all perfectly done here though overall. The music is a highlight here too which is sometimes hilarious and reminded me of the Lego movie in some ways. Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie are both pitch perfect here as well. Definitely recommend anyone to give it a chance. I wouldn't say this is a family movie but I think families with older kids would work perfectly for this. Not sure this will be in the Oscar race but it seems like it will at least for technical aspects and production designs.","Review_Url":"\/review\/rw9239935\/?ref_=tt_urv"}

Again honest - I went there just for Margot Robbie (I'm a married 34 year old male, and margot is one of my top 3 favorite actrices of all time, and arguably the most talented one from my list). And for that part it was totally ok. But the movie absolutely doesn't deserve an imdb rating above 5.6. The plot itself was very simple. Absolutely nothing particularly special in it. So if it is in fact getting rated so high just because of Margot alone, then why do her other movies don't get rated that well and get that much attention? Honestly I really don't understand and I think this movie is way too overhyped for no reason. And I have no idea why... For other movies that get hyped like that I do see the reasons why they're getting so hyped. So the movie is not awful, but it's rather average, if you're not going there specifically for Margot then I am pretty sure there will be multiple movies at your local cinema at the time you're reading this, which are way more worth watching than this one...","Review_Url":"\/review\/rw9239935\/?ref_=tt_urv"}

{"Review_Date":"1 August 2023","Author":"fredrikgunerius","Rating":"5","Review_Title":" A trite, divisive and most likely futile battle of the sexes\n","Review":"The big summer blockbuster of 2023 is a wonderful visual spectacle with a great deal of creative physical comedy, centered in and around the universe of Barbie, Mattel's historic toy doll. Unfortunately, the film tries to be and do much more than what the filmmakers ultimately are able to control and reel in. That a movie about Barbie would be guilty of Americanization is no surprise, and in many ways more than befitting, but the Americanization here isn't just about the history of the toy itself and all its cultural impacts - Barbie also views everything through the eyes of Hollywood anno 2023 - which arguably is a very particular and perhaps not that representative outlook. Instead of utilizing the fine foundation laid in the film's first third, director and co-writer Greta Gervig (Lady Bird, Little Women) gets herself lost in a trite, divisive and most likely futile battle of the sexes, which will leave youths - and perhaps particularly Europeans - feeling confused and conflicted. The filmmakers' supposed toying with stereotypes ultimately becomes more of a playing into them, especially towards the end when Gerwig staggers along desperately looking for closure and something meaningful to say. Alas, Barbie has ended up as a rather sad symptom of our times, when it could have been the wonderfully funny piece of femininity-appraising escapism it started out as. There are nonetheless several highlights here, such as the delightfully absurd opening sequence (a fine nod to Kubrick's 2001), the initial introduction of Barbie and Ken's days in Barbieland, and - of course - their first encounter with the real world.","Review_Url":"\/review\/rw9239935\/?ref_=tt_urv"}

{"Review_Date":"15 August 2023","Author":"EUyeshima","Rating":"8","Review_Title":" Perceptive Take on the Barbie Mythos\n","Review":"There's a bold and consistent current of subversive humanism that runs through this infectious 2023 satire that director Greta Gerwig manages with stylish aplomb. She and partner Noah Baumbach have taken the Barbie mythos and built a multilayered narrative around the evolving nature of female identity and empowerment within the context of male dominance and the patriarchy that has defined sexual roles since the beginning of time. However, this is neither a treatise nor a polemic. It's still primarily a fun, free-wheeling farce with Day-Glo colors and silly choreography filling up the screen with zestful energy informed by a knowing perspective. Margot Robbie is ideally cast in the title role as she epitomizes stereotypical Barbie. Ryan Gosling gives Ken the right level of disempowerment as he gets taken in by the lure of toxic masculinity. The rest of the cast appear equally game. Gerwig has truly applied a perceptive twist to a candy-coated girlhood memory.","Review_Url":"\/review\/rw9239935\/?ref_=tt_urv"}

America Ferrera's monologue in Barbie Land had people clapping in the theatre. I appreciated it as a Mother, daughter, sister, wife and human being. The truth bombs she dropped got me right in the feels. I know. You are likely rolling your eyes and balking at the sheer IDEA that a BARBIE movie could be in any way profound.

Barbie is the role Robbie was clearly born to play. Ryan Gosling and Simu Liu were incredible too and actually the whole cast of this movie shines ! Barbie is a brilliantly executed, incredibly fun, brightly colored, completely logical feminist statement that should be remembered come awards season. Ultimately, Barbie is so many things: a stereotype, a toy, an idea; a vessel of imagination; a cultural relic. But in Gerwig's trusted hands, this is Barbie like you've never seen her before.","Review_Url":"\/review\/rw9239935\/?ref_=tt_urv"}

But it was too much, I do not enjoy politics in movies, whether it's left or right. I expected it to be more fun, and feel good, and it was for some parts but not enough at all. Ryan was great and so was Margot but I did not understand why Barbie didn't like Ken, it's wildly known that Barbie loves Ken and Ken loves Barbie, it's iconic and it made no sense for everything else in Barbie land to be accurate but not that. Another problem was the writing it was very \"told and not shown\" as well as wordy. The scenery was great as well as the costumes, but the story could have been so much better. Like Barbie and Ken take L. A. on a fun adventure and some self-discovery but it wasn't really like that. The ending was confusing does Barbie want to have a baby?","Review_Url":"\/review\/rw9239935\/?ref_=tt_urv"}

This film is a treat for Barbie lovers because the way director has told the storyline by introducing a whole barbie world and their characters is interesting to watch. Specially MARGOT ROBBIE what and actress she is her looks, style, acting performances, dresses of barbie all are top notch. Margot Robbie is perfectly suited for this role because she is the only one carrying the whole movie throughout the end. From start to end the main highlight of the this film is Margot Robbie. I've only watched this film for her and she has proved that currently she is one of the best actress in Hollywood. When I talk about supporting cast RYAN GOSLING is the only one who has done justice to the character of Ken rest are just average. Story is the main disappointment of the film, Film starts on a good note with laughs and riot of chaos when Barbie enters into the real world but after a bit of time story get exaggerated and only focuses on the central character which is the drawback of the film and from that case movie doesn't get the chance to give space to the other important characters. Background score and songs are good that wil give you a fresh vibe while watching this film. All n all this movie is a treat for Barbie fans and rest of the audience may consider as an average content....","Review_Url":"\/review\/rw9239935\/?ref_=tt_urv"}

It's a perfect mix of existentialism, heartfelt and important social-commentary and unapologetic silliness. This is the most fun I've had at a movie in a long time - and yet thanks to Gerwig's incredible script it also manages to be very a profound exploration of feminism, existentialism, the patriarchy, and masculinity all packaged in a satirical musical comedy homage to the fabric of cinema.","Review_Url":"\/review\/rw9239935\/?ref_=tt_urv"}

One may say it is a story of strength, and finding the beauty in yourself. Others, may just not like it. I am in the middle of all of that. The movie was a little better than meh, but lacked in some aspects that it could have dealt with more. I think Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were good, but I really didn't like their characters (Mostly Ken) The musical numbers and camera work were amazing. But, by far three things stood out to me. One, the costumes design and sets. The directors sculpted amazing set design with colorful costumes to go along with it. My honorable mention is Rhea Perlman. I thought she was phenomenal. While anyone could play that role she really brought it. Finally, America Ferrara. Since her days on Ugly Betty, she has became a household name. But in this movie she was wonderful. I enjoyed Superstore quite a bit and wanted to see Barbie mainly for her character. Her speech was moving and she brought so much to her simple, yet relatable mom.","Review_Url":"\/review\/rw9239935\/?ref_=tt_urv"}

I had high hopes. Unfortunately, it fell short. Barbie takes us on a journey, with Margot Robbie portraying \"Stereotypical\" Barbie as she leaves her world of Barbieland and enters the Real World. She encounters friends, overcomes challenges, and discovers important lessons about herself and others. Barbie doesn't always hit the mark while attempting to blend comedy, drama and fantasy elements. The plot feels predictable and filled with clich\u00e9s, and the theme and tone are sometimes inconsistent and confusing.

{"Review_Date":"21 July 2023","Author":"GusherPop","Rating":"10","Review_Title":" Greta shows real power of woman in Barbie\n","Review":"Greta Gerwig's Barbie explores creation myths in Barbieland, a parallel universe populated by Mattel dolls. The director uses the toy conglomerate's vast archive and successful products as tools to create a rich and weird material. The movie is a clever send-up of Barbie dolls and their legacy, featuring light-hearted jokes that poke fun at Mattel, the doll's lore, and the contradictions of our sexist society. The director's storytelling is impressive, and the film's humor is both lighthearted and chuckle-worthy. Gerwig's Barbieland, created by Sarah Greenwood and Jacqueline Durran, is a pink fever dream with funky compositions by Mark Ronson and Andrew Wyatt, bubblegum anthems by Dua Lipa, Nicki Minaj, and Ice Spice. The film features plastic trees and identical two-story Barbie dream homes, with flying being the preferred mode of transportation. The production design and costuming are exceptional, showcasing Gerwig's passion for details and her ability to create a dreamlike world. Barbieland is a feminist utopia in which Barbies serve as presidents, Supreme Court members, doctors, physicists, Nobel prize winners, and cancer cures. The dolls are not structurally different from our world, but they are represented by political fantasy and decade-dependent what-ifs. Barbie has gone to space, could vote, and own property before many human women, and her appearance has changed to mirror society's beauty politics. The representational doll has become an extension of political fantasy, reflecting the beauty politics of society. Gerwig features a cast of Barbies, including Issa Rae, Emma Mackey, Alexandra Shipp, and Hari Nef. Stereotypical Barbie (Margot Robbie) is the protagonist, a blonde-haired, blue-eyed Barbie created by Ruth Handler. Her Ken counterpart, Ryan Gosling, is portrayed with humor and heart. They are a version of Eve and Adam, with their fall being dramatic. Barbie finds her perfect life hampered by existential thoughts and seeks answers from Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon), a doll with a traumatic history. Stereotypical Barbie, with Ken, heads to real-world Los Angeles to find her little girl. The relationship between Barbies and their human owners is tenuously outlined, so it's best not to think too deeply about how it all works. Robbie's performance in Gerwig's Barbie highlights the tension between Barbie as an object and subject. Her expressive eyes and physical presence reveal the human world's forces, while her rigid presence in Barbieland suggests she's not less rigid in the real world. Despite the director's skill in capturing deeper themes, the film's ominousness and muddied politics suggest it ultimately serves a brand. The film's ominousness and muddied politics suggest the film serves as a brand. Gerwig's film Barbieland is a mix of fun and emotional depth, with a tension between keeping Barbie entertaining and blending her source material with previous projects. After a detour, Barbie returns home to find Ken's patriarchal knowledge has transformed Barbieland. The screenplay, by Gerwig and Noah Baumbach, avoids familiarity and mockery, but the moments that aren't just funny are buried in important monologues, making the gestures feel politically hollow. The film's mandate is too ambitious, making it feel politically hollow.","Review_Url":"\/review\/rw9239935\/?ref_=tt_urv"}
